# [VCL](https://vcl.github.io/) material-design-icons

Integration with the [material design icons](http://materialdesignicons.com/).

## Features

A complete icon set for web applications inspired by Google's
[material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).
The icons are vector graphics which can be scaled without quality loss.
The different icon states for hover and active as well as
different color themes like normal or emphasized
are simply realized by CSS styling.

## Usage

This module just includes the original CSS from the
[mdi module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/font).
Make sure the font files are not located below a path `../fonts/`,
or re-define the `src` properties in the `@font-face` definition.
