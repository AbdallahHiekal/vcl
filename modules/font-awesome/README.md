# [VCL](https://github.com/vcl/vcl/doc) font-awesome

Integration with the [font awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon font.

## Features

A complete icon set for web applications.
The icons are vector graphics which can be scaled without quality loss.
The different icon states for hover and active as well as
different color themes like normal or emphasized
are simply realized by CSS styling.

## Usage

It integrates the standard FA CSS and makes some minor adaptations for
the VCL.
Make sure the font files are not located below a path `../fonts/`,
or re-define the `src` properties in the `@font-face` definition.

## Classes

See [font awesome icon catalog](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) for a reference
of available icons.
