# [VCL](https://github.com/vcl/doc) size-modulation

Scale the size of text and whole widgets.

## Features

Can scale the size of simple text and whole widgets comprised of
multiple components as far as they use relative units
that depend on the font-size in the context, like `em` for.
As this is true for VCL components, they can be applied to any of them.

## Usage

Scale the size of simple text and whole widgets.

The size modulation can be applied to whole widgets like this
pagination at 115%.
