# [VCL](https://vcl.github.io/) icogram

The combination of icon(s) and a textual label(s) in any permutation.

## Features

The `vclIcogram` is a wrapper for `vclText` and `vclIcon`
which can occur in arbitrary order and count.
The layout of labels and icons (horizontal and vertical) is created using the
classes from the flex layout module.
In the horizontal layout, the icogram applies a small gap in form of a margin
between the elements. In the vertical layout no margin is applied.

## Usage

Horizontal alignment.
